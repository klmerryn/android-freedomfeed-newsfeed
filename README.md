Social-purpose-themed RSS, Atom and Twitter aggregator

This is the beginning of a news aggregator that integrates multipl curated RSS, Atom and Twitter feeds into a single feed. 
Thematic topics can be selected or custom feeds can be added by the user; and default topics have themes of social justice, 
freedom of expression and internet freedom, however these topics can also be customized.

Each topic cluster contains a pre-curated set of RSS/Atom feeds and/or follows Twitter hashtags on certain themes.
This allows the user to receive news aggregated from many sources. 

The goal of this project was to spend a few days learning more about multiple facets of Android development.

Soon-to-be-implemented:
   - Persistence features: a simple splashscreen before the 'welcome' page and ability to 
     redirect to the feed after first-time setup; persistence of feed choices via SQLite3 db

Backlog:
   - ability to save/favourite/share news items
   - on-the-fly customization (swiping to remove items)
   - improved GUI, including differentiating between already viewed and new items, better layout and colour scheme, etc
